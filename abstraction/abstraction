hiding the unneccessary deils and only showing the neccassry details.

for eg;
we use arraylist ,arrays and..
eg..static void greetings(){
    sout(hello);
}
so we just want to use arrlist or to print hello...but in debugger there so whole a lot information that how it is defined internally...which is good but if we will use that in code it will be unneccessary.











encapsulation is developer level problem..
abstract is designer level problem..
